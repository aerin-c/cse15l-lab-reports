# Lab Report 1 - Remote Access and FileSystem
This is the write-up for the first lab that was assigned during Week 1. Below are examples for each command using the workspace created on EdStem.

## cd
1. Using only `cd`, nothing is returned as can be seen in the image below. Nothing changes because there is no new path to change the directory to. The working directory is `/home` which is to be expected since there is no new directory being used. The output is not an error since should not return anything if you are not changing your directory. ![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aerin-c/cse15l-lab-reports/main/Screenshot%202023-10-02%20at%2011.17.57.png)
2. Using `cd` with a directory modifies the path within the brackets when the new line in the terminal appears, showing that the transition to the given path has been occurred. The working directory when the command was run is `/home/lecture1` which is expected since the directory was changed to the path noted in the command. This is a transition from the inital working directory which was `/home` since that is the default directory. The output is not an error because it has successfully carried out the change from `/home` to `/home/lecture1` and also throws no errors in the following line. ![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aerin-c/cse15l-lab-reports/main/Screenshot%202023-10-02%20at%2011.39.20.png)
3. Using `cd` with a path to a file does not work because the file is not considered a directory. A directory needs to be a folder that can be opened and changed to. Using `cd` on the path to a file will throw up an error as a result of being a file and not a directory. The working directory when the command was run is `/home` because it is not a valid directory to change to. ![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aerin-c/cse15l-lab-reports/main/Screenshot%202023-10-09%20at%2013.56.25.png)

## ls
1. Using `ls` with no arguments shows the files and folders within `/home` since that is the default directory. This means that what comes out is `lecture1` since that is the folder within `/home`. The working directory for this command is `/home` because `ls` does not change the directory to a different path. It is not an error since it provides the expected output of `lecture1`. ![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aerin-c/cse15l-lab-reports/main/Screenshot%202023-10-09%20at%2014.05.21.png)
2. Using `ls` with a path to a directory returns the files and folders within the directory. In this case, `./lecture1` is the folder that `ls` is finding the files and folders so what it prints is exactly what is inside `./lecture1` as seen in the image. The working directory is `/home` because the command does not open any directories. The output is not an error because it lists all the files and folders within `./lecture1` and it matches what should be found when looking inside `./lecture1`. ![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aerin-c/cse15l-lab-reports/main/Screenshot%202023-10-09%20at%2014.17.57.png)
3. Using `ls` with a path to a file returns the absolute path that is provided because a file has nothing inside it. So all that gets returned is the file itself since it is a file within the given path. The working directory is `/home` since there are no changes in the directory. It is not an error since `ls` is supposed to list the files and folders within a given path and there is only one file in the given path for a file. ![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aerin-c/cse15l-lab-reports/main/Screenshot%202023-10-09%20at%2014.25.09.png)

## cat
1. Using `cat` with no arguments produces nothing since there is nothing to print the contents of since there are no paths that lead to files. The working directory is `/home` since there is no command that changes the directory. The output is not an error since it just runs and does not have anything printed since there is nothing to print.

2. Using `cat` with a path to a directory produces a line describing how printing anything is possible due to the type of argument given. This makes sense since the path leads to a directory which is something that `cat` will not print or be able to do anything with. The working directory is `/home` because `cat` does not change the working directory. The output is not an error since it is explaining that directories are not capable of being used by `cat` to print anything.

3. Using `cat` with a path to a file prints the entire file of `Hello.java` which is expected since it is a file and can be printed by `cat` due to how it functions. The working directory is `/home` since `cat` does not have the function of changing directories. The output is not an error since it produces the contents of `Hello.java` as expected. ![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aerin-c/cse15l-lab-reports/main/Screenshot%202023-10-09%20at%2014.38.51.png)
