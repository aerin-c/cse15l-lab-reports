# Lab Report 1 - Remote Access and FileSystem
This is the write-up for the first lab that was assigned during Week 1. Below are examples for each command using the workspace created on EdStem.

## cd
1. Using only `cd`, nothing is returned as can be seen in the image below. The working directory is `/home` which is to be expected since there is no new directory being used. The output is not an error since should not return anything if you are not changing your directory. ![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aerin-c/cse15l-lab-reports/main/Screenshot%202023-10-02%20at%2011.17.57.png)
2. Using `cd` with a directory returns a like showing that now the new region has been opened. ![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aerin-c/cse15l-lab-reports/main/Screenshot%202023-10-02%20at%2011.39.20.png)
