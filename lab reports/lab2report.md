## SSH Keys


## New Knowledge
What I learned from lab in Week 3 was how to set up an SSH key and make it so I did not have to remember a password to log in. I thought it was pretty neat that there was a way to autofill a password and log-in details via the terminal. Before learning how to do that, I never really knew how it worked since I only ever saw the UI and not the back-end.
