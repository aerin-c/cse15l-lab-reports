# Lab Report 4 - Vim
This is a write-up for the fourth lab assigned during Week 7.

## ieng6 Log In (Lab Task, Step 4)
Key(s) pressed:
```<up><enter>```
I have recently logged into ieng6 so my log in is the previous bash command. Using the up key once allows me to access the command and log me in.

## Clone the Fork of the Repository (Lab Task, Step 5)
Key(s) pressed:
```<up><up><up><up><up><up><enter>```
The `git clone` command using the SSH was further up in my command log within my ieng6 terminal so it took more presses of the up button to get to the command.

## Run the Tests (Lab Task, Step 6)
Key(s) pressed:
```<up><up><up><up><enter>,<up><up><up><enter>```
The `javac` and `java` commands for the test file were not as far up in my commands. As a result, they required less presses to bring back up. I accessed both commands the same way since they were both within my command log history.

## Edit the Code File to Fix the Failing Test (Lab Task, Step 7)
Key(s) pressed:
```<up><up><enter>,<44><g><g>,<e><r><2>```
The `vim` command was not too far up in my command list because I needed to look at the contents of various files. Then using my newly learned vim commands I figured out what line the change needed to be at and used `gg` to get me there by adding the line number in front of the `gg`. Then I shortened what I did by using `e` which allows me to skip to the end of `index1` and `r` to replace the `1` with the `2`.

## Re-Run the Tests (Lab Task, Step 8)
Key(s) pressed:
```<up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><enter>,<up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><enter>```
Due to the number of commands I ran, the position of the `javac` and `java` commands were further back than initially. I ran them both by using the up button and hitting enter.

## Push the Changes to GitHub (Lab Task, Step 9)
Key(s) pressed:
```<up><up><up><up><enter>,<up><up><up><up><enter>,<up><up><up><up><enter>```
The commands were more recent since I wanted to experiment to make sure that things were being committed properly before I pushed the final changes.
