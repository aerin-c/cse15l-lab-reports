# Lab Report 4 - Vim
This is a write-up for the fourth lab assigned during Week 7.

## ieng6 Log In (Lab Task, Step 4)
Key(s) pressed:
```<up><enter>```
I have recently logged into ieng6 so my log in is the previous bash command. Using the up key once allows me to access the command and log me in.

## Clone the Fork of the Repository (Lab Task, Step 5)
Key(s) pressed:
```<up><up><up><up><up><up><enter>```
The `git clone` command using the SSH was further up in my command log within my ieng6 terminal so it took more presses of the up button to get to the command.
